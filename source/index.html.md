# Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Oracle API documentation. An oracle provides data into the blockchain that cannot be accessed by the blockchain itself, due to consensus constraints. The Smart Oracle makes it easy to integrate external data with the blockchain, both passing it in and sending it out.

See the section on [Assignments](#assignments) for information on how to specify the data you would like to connect to the blockchain.

The Smart Oracle is the core of the Oracle Kit, [learn more here](https://dev.smartcontract.com).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- a running instance of Postgres, version 9.3 or above
- a running instance of Ethereum with the [JSON-RPC interface](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) enabled

### Install

```shell
docker pull smartcontract/smartoracle
docker run -it --env-file=.env smartcontract/smartoracle rake oracle:initialize
```

First set up your configuration, by creating a `.env` file, that has at least the variables set in the [.env example](https://github.com/oraclekit/smart_oracle/blob/master/spec/support/dotenv.example).

Once you have set up your database and configuration, and you are ready to initialize the Smart Oracle.

On initialization, the oracle will give the option to print the first list of coordinator credentials. Be sure to record the coordinator credentials for use with the oracle moving forward.

### Run

```shell
docker run -t --env-file=.env smartcontract/smartoracle
```

Once the database and Etehreum node are set up, you can run your oracle with your configured environment.

For more information on setting up an instance, or building it locally, visit the [wiki page on installation](https://github.com/oraclekit/smart_oracle/wiki/Install). Alternatively, if you want to view the source code, you can do so on [GitHub](https://github.com/oraclekit/smart_oracle).

To have a managed instance spun up for you, contact us at [support@smartcontract.com](mailto:support@smartcontract.com).

## Authentication

```shell
curl -u apiKey:apiSecret
  http://localhost:6688/assignments/f0577c3e-9e5a-4840-9c9b-37d326c3d2e3
```
Both coordinators and adapters need to authenticate to access the data they are allowed access to. In both cases authentication is handled via HTTP Authentication.

### Coordinator Authentication

To access an assignment you must have a set of coordinator credentials. An initial set of coordinator credentials are generated and printed when the node's `initialize` command is run.

All assignments are associated with a coordinator, so in order to create an assignment you must authenticate using its coordinator's credentials. After creating an assignment all subsequent updates will be sent to its coordinator, if the coordinator has specified a URL.

### Adapter Authentication

Assignments can optionally be associated with an external adapter. The adapter credentials are automatically generated when the adapter record is created. From then on the Smart Oracle requires that all communication to and from that adapter must be authenticated.


# Assignments

The work specified for a Smart Oracle is called an Assignment. [Assignments](#assignments) can be handled by the oracle itself, or the oracle's capabilities can be expanded by creating an adapter for the oracle.

Assignments make up the specifcation of the work, but each piece of the ongoing work is captured in a snapshot. [Snapshots](#create-assignment-snapshot) are generated by whichever adapter is handling the work, recorded by the oracle, and reported back to the coordinator.


## Anatomy of an Assignment
Assignments are the core of the Smart Oracle model, they are the specifications of work given to an oracle. The main pieces of an assignment consist of the [adapter](#adapter-type-and-parameters), the [scheduling](#scheduling), and the [payment specification](#payment). Optionally, an assignment can have a description and signatures from the parties involved.

### Adapter Type and Parameters
Every assignment has a type, which specifies the kind of adapter the oracle will use to perform the work requested. Each different type of adapter requires different parameters, some passed on the blockchain, some passed off chain. The parameters each adapter will accept are specified ahead of time by the adapter's creator.

The current Smart Oracle ships with several built in adapters: `ethereumBytes32` for writing strings into Ethereum, `ethereumInt256` for writing signed integers into Ethereum, `ethereumUint256` for writing unsigned integer into Ethereum, `httpGetJSON` for retrieving JSON across the web, and `bitcoinComparisonJSON` for releasing Bitcoin escrow based on the values of JSON APIs. For more information on setting up custom adapters, see the section on [creating an adapter](/#adapter-integration).

### Subtasks
```json
{
  "adapterType": "ethereumBytes32",
  "adapterParams": {
    "address": "0x34d946ab16079a97976e006079efe422b1fe1905",
    "method": "8b147245"
  }
}
```
Subtasks are a series of steps taken by the oracle to complete an assignment. Each time an assignment is updated it processes its pipeline of subtasks, each of which is handled by an [adapter](#adapter-type-and-parameters). The subtask's initial configuration, along with any data passed from earlier subtasks in the pipeline are passed to the adapter for each update. The adapter's output for the subtask is passed to the next subtask, until the final subtask's output determines the values of the assignment's latest [snapshot](#snapshots).

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
adapterType | string | identifies the type of work to be done
adapterParams | object | a JSON object meeting the requirements of the adapter's schema, setting the initial configuration for the adapter

### Scheduling
Some oracle services are needed on a scheduled basis. For these use cases, the Smart Oracle a simple way to schedule tasks based on the [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) scheduling format, or specify specific times to run at.

Assignments that do not require a schedule, instead work on demand, can skip the schedule or offer a combination of both on demand updates and scheduled updates.

All assignments require a end time and allow for an optional start time, defaulting to the assignment start time. Times are specified using Unix timestamps(UTC).

```json
{
  "minute": "1",
  "hour": "17",
  "dayOfMonth": "*",
  "monthOfYear": "*",
  "dayOfWeek": "*",
  "startAt": "1477941966",
  "endAt": "1793474734",
  "runAt": ["1518726087", "1802722889"]
}
```

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
minute | string | cron style minute listing for how often to run recurring snapshots
hour | string | cron style hour listing for how often to run recurring snapshots
dayOfMonth | string | cron style day of month listing for how often to run recurring snapshots
monthOfYear | string | cron style month of year listing for how often to run recurring snapshots
dayOfWeek | string | cron style day of week listing for how often to run recurring snapshots
startAt | string | a unix timestamp for when to start the recurring snapshot schedule. Optional defaults to the time the assignment is created.
endAt | string | a unix timestamp for when to end the recurring snapshot schedule
runAt | array | an array of unix timestamps for discrete update times


### Payment
```json
{
  "currency": "ETH",
  "perDay": "0",
  "perRequest": "1000000000000000"
}
```
Space on blockchains is limited and thus costly to utilize. On the other side of the oracle, API calls to protected APIs are often behind pay walls. Oracle services by their nature come with expenses. For this reason, the Smart Oracle platform has a way to specify service prices for each adapter.

Prices are generally set per request made by the oracle; This can be prepaid for scheduled services, or paid per request for on demand services. Additionally, prices can be set based on the duration of required availability of the oracle.

The currency is configurable based on the networks that the oracle operates in. Currency amounts are always specified in the lowest possible denomination of the currency(Satoshis, Wei, etc.).

}
```

A `POST` to `/assignments` will return the `XID`, or external ID, which is used to identify the assignment in the future. The response also includes a hash of the assignment specified, and a signature of that hash to attest to the oracle's acceptance of the assignment.

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
subtasks | array | an ordered list of the assignment's [subtasks](#subtasks)
schedule | object | an [assignment schedule object](#scheduling)
version | string | specify the version of the [assignment spec](https://github.com/smartoracles/spec), use "1.0.0" for the latest version


<aside class="success">
Make sure to grab the XID to refer to the assignment in the future. The assignment hash is intentionally not used in the future, as the XID is not easily linkable with the assignment.

# Coordinator Updates

Once an assignment is created, it will automatically run and update itself based on its schedule and the logic in the adapter. Updates cannot be fed in by the coordinator, but the coordinator can receive push notifications whenever the assignment is updated. Simply set the URL of the assignment's coordinator to receive push notifications.

All push notifications are authorized with the same credentials used to create the assignment.

## Create Assignment Oracle
```json
{
  "oracle": {
    "address": "0x72c8379f845bb3cb30e02ef1feb84742debc1efb",
    "jsonABI": "contract Oracle {\n  bytes32 currentValue;\n  address creator;\n\n  function Oracle() {\n    creator = msg.sender;\n  }\n\n  function update(bytes32 newCurrent) {\n    if (msg.sender != creator) return;\n    currentValue = newCurrent;\n  }\n\n  function current() constant returns (bytes32 current) {\n    return currentValue;\n  }\n\n  function () constant returns (bytes32 current) {\n    return currentValue;\n  }\n}",

  },
  "xid": "f0577c3e-9e5a-4840-9c9b-37d326c3d2e3"
}
```

`POST` to `/assignments/:xid/instructions`

If an assignment needs some on-chain setup, it cannot immediately respond with all of its integration details on creation, it needs to wait for the blockchain confirmations before. Once the confirmations needed for the assignment set up have occured, the oracle will push integration instructions to the coordinator.

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
address | string | Ethereum address location
jsonABI | string | a stringified version of the JSON ABI for the contract
readAddress | string | the hash for the read function of the Ethereum contract
solidityABI | string | the Solidity ABI to include in a contract using this oracle
xid | string | the XID of the related assignment

}
```

`POST` to `/assignments/:assignment_xid/snapshots`

Each time the assignment is updated it creates a snapshot. A snapshot is the current status of the assignment. Whenever a snapshot is created, it is pushed to the coordinator. Further information is provided in machine readable form in the `details` section, in various formats depending on the adapter. Information is provided in human readable form in the `summary` and `description` fields, as well as the `descriptionURL`.

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
signatures | array(string) | if a signature is required, like for Bitcoin escrow, it returns a signature for the outcome that was determined
status | string | Either "completed" or "failed"

# Adapters

Adapters are where all the actual computation for the oracle happens. The Smart Oracle ships with several adapters, known as Core Adapters. External Adapters can be configured if you would like to configure custom behavior and computation.

# Core Adapters

Core Adapters are the built in adapters that ship with the Smart Oracle. Below are the types of adapters available out of the box:

## bitcoinComparisonJSON

Parses a GET request to a JSON API, compares the parsed value to the value passed into the configuration. Returns the signature of a Bitcoin transaction. If the comparison succeeds then adapter signs the success transaction, if the comparison does not succeed, no transaction is signed. If the deadline for the assignment passes, then the failure transaction is signed.

### Configuration

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
comparison | string | The operation used to compare the base value to the dynamic value. Options: `===`, `<`, `>`, or `contains`.
endpoint | string | The URL that the JSON is pulled from.
fields | array | The key path to follow to get the value to compare with the base value.
value | string | The base value which is compared to they dynamic value. If possible the base value is coerced to the type of the dynamic value, if it is not possible the comparison is treated as false and an empty value is returned.

## ethereumBytes32

Formats the input as Ethereum bytes32 value and writes it into the specified contract. Deploys an oracle contract that is updated if a contract address is not provided. Returns the input value converted to a string and shortened to 32 characters, and the transaction ID of the update issued.

### Configuration

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
address | string | (optional) Ethereum address to send the data to, if a contract to update already exists.
functionID | string | (optional) Ethereum function ID to send the data to, if a contract to update already exists.

### Update Input

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | Converted to a string from which the first 32 bytes are pulled and formatted to be written into Ethereum `bytes32` format.

### Update Output

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | The input value passed in, converted to string, and then pulled the first 32 bytes.
txid | string | ID of the transaction that was written into Ethereum to create the update.

## ethereumFormatted

Writes a preformatted Ethereum hexadecimal value into the blockchain as configured. Returns the preformatted value that was provided as input.

`ethereumFormatted` can also be used as an alarm clock, which is preconfigured to call a function on a transaction.

### Configuration

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
address | string | Ethereum address to send the data to.
functionID | string | Ethereum function ID to send the data to.
data | string | (optional) Hex value to be sent in. This value is used as a fallback if no input value is passed in.
amount | string | (optional) Amount of Ether to send to the contract along with the data.

### Update Input

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | Hexadecimal value that will be sent in to the Ethereum contract. Requires the value already be formatted as hex.

### Update Output

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | The input value passed in as hexadecimal.
txid | string | ID of the transaction that was written into Ethereum to create the update.

## ethereumInt256

Formats the input as Ethereum int256 value and writes it into the specified contract. Deploys an oracle contract that is updated if a contract address is not provided. Returns the input value multiplied by the `resultMultiplier` and converted to an integer, and the transaction ID of the update issued.

Due to constraints in the EVM, decimal value were not represented. The `resultMultiplier` parameter is an optional parameter to address that. If an input value has a decimal, the multiplier allows you to capture the decimal information by multiplying the value and increasing it orders of magnitude. For example if an API for Bitcoin price in US Dollars returns cents, you can set the multiplier to `100`, and the value `2452.75` will be converted to `245275`. By default the value is set to `1`.

### Configuration

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
address | string | (optional) Ethereum address to send the data to, if a contract to update already exists.
functionID | string | (optional) Ethereum function ID to send the data to, if a contract to update already exists.
resultMultiplier | integer | (optional) Amount to multiply the value passed in by. Allows for decimal value to be increased so that their precision is accounted for by integers. Defaults to 1.

### Update Input

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | Multiplied by the `resultMultiplier` and converted to an integer, then formatted to be written into Ethereum `int256` format.

### Update Output

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | integer | The input value passed in mutliplied by the `resultMultiplier` and converted to an integer.
txid | string | ID of the transaction that was written into Ethereum to create the update.

## ethereumLogWatcher

If an Ethereum event log which matches the configured filters is created, the adapter triggers a new snapshot. Wherever the adapter is in the pipeline, it stores the event log and uses that as the output passes down the pipeline.

If this adapter is present and a snapshot is triggered, but no event log is present, this adapter passes its inputs to the next adapter as its output, unmodified.

Useful for creating "pull" based oracles where the oracle values are requested on demand.

### Configuration

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
address | string | Ethereum address to send the data to.
functionID | string | Ethereum function ID to send the data to.
data | string | (optional) Hex value to be sent in. This value is used as a fallback if no input value is passed in.
amount | string | (optional) Amount of Ether to send to the contract along with the data.

### Update Input

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | Hexadecimal value that will be sent in to the Ethereum contract. Requires the value already be formatted as hex.

### Update Output

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | The hexadecimal input value passed in.
txid | string | ID of the transaction that was written into Ethereum to create the update.

## ethereumUint256

Formats the input as Ethereum int256 value and writes it into the specified contract. Deploys an oracle contract that is updated if a contract address is not provided. Returns the input value multiplied by the `resultMultiplier` and converted to a positive integer, and the transaction ID of the update issued.

Due to constraints in the EVM, decimal value were not represented. The `resultMultiplier` parameter is an optional parameter to address that. If an input value has a decimal, the multiplier allows you to capture the decimal information by multiplying the value and increasing it orders of magnitude. For example if an API for Bitcoin price in US Dollars returns cents, you can set the multiplier to `100`, and the value `2452.75` will be converted to `245275`. By default the value is set to `1`.

### Configuration

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
address | string | (optional) Ethereum address to send the data to, if a contract to update already exists.
functionID | string | (optional) Ethereum function ID to send the data to, if a contract to update already exists.
resultMultiplier | integer | (optional) Amount to multiply the value passed in by. Allows for decimal value to be increased so that their precision is accounted for by integers. Defaults to 1.

### Update Input

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | Multiplied by the `resultMultiplier` and converted to a positive integer, then formatted to be written into Ethereum `uint256` format.

### Update Output

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | integer | The input value passed in mutliplied by the `resultMultiplier` and converted to a positive integer.
txid | string | ID of the transaction that was written into Ethereum to create the update.

## httpGetJSON

Retrieves JSON and returns the specific field selected in the configuration.

Parses a specific field out of the response of a GET request to a JSON API.

### Configuration

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
url | string | The URL that the JSON is pulled from.
fields | array | The key path to follow to get the value to compare with the base value.
basicAuth | object | (optional) JSON Object containing `username` and `password` fields.
headers | string | (optional) Headers to be included in request.

### Update Input

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
_value | string | (optional) Input parameters are not used by this adapter.

### Update Output

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | The value parsed out of the JSON API.

## jsonReceiver

Generates a URL for the oracle to receive JSON push notifications. Parses the pushed JSON and returns the specific field selected in the configuration.

If this adapter is present and a snapshot is triggered, but no request was made to the API, this adapter passes its inputs to the next adapter as its output, unmodified.

Useful for creating "pull" based oracles where the oracle values are requested on demand.

### Configuration

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
fields | array | The key path to follow to get the value to compare with the base value.

### Update Input

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
_value | string | (optional) Input parameters are not used by this adapter.

### Update Output

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
value | string | The value parsed out of the JSON API.
details | object | The full JSON payload passed into the oracle API endpoint.

# External Adapters

The Smart Oracle image ships with functionality out of the box to connect Ethereum contracts and Bitcoin escrow to JSON APIs(the lingua franca of the web). But the real power of the Smart Oracle platform lies in its abilitiy to be extended.

Adapters can be configured with the Smart Oracle core to add functionality. Whether it's a different data format like XML, or special computation, the Smart Oracle makes it possible to further extend off-chain capabilities via adapters.

### APIs

Adapters integrate with the core in a service oriented model, so they can run locally, next to the core or on remote servers. The minimum integrations an adapter needs to support are based on whether the adapter will push information or the core will pull. The APIs needed to create a custom adapter are listed below.

### Oracle Schema

In order to make an adapter's input and output predictable, adapters need to specify schemas. Schemas are created using a JSON Schema for expected prerequisites and on/off-chain inputs/outputs. See the [specification here](https://github.com/smartoracles/spec).


## Create Assignment

__*Required*__: `POST` to adapter path `/assignments`

The action used for an oracle to pass an assignment over to an adapter.

The expected response should include:

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
xid | string | the unique identifier to associate an assignment with
endAt | string | a timestamp in Unix Timestamp(UTC) format.
data | object | a JSON object containing all information specified in the adapter's schema


## Create Snapshot _(Pull)_

`POST` to adapter path `/assignments/:assignment_xid/snapshots`

The action used for an oracle to pass an assignment over to an adapter.

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
description | string | a detailed human readable description of the snapshot
descriptionURL | string | a supporting URL relating to the update
details | object | a JSON object of extra supporting information returned by the adapter
fulfilled | boolean | marks whether the snapshot has been completed or not
status | string | a description of the assignment's current status
summary | string | a short human readable summary of the snapshot
value | string | the latest value returned by the adapter
xid | string | a unique external ID to identify the snapshot by

### Unfulfilled Snapshots

Creating a snapshot may require more time than you are willing to leave a request hanging for. Snapshots that are requested via the pull style can be marked as unfulfilled upon creation, and fulfilled at a later time.

In order to fulfill an unfulfilled snapshot you must implement the update snapshot integration.


## Delete Assignment

`DELETE` to `/assignments/:xid`

Used to indicate the end of an assignment.

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
status | string | optional string to specify the final state of the assignment
xid | string | identifier of the assignment


## Create Snapshot _(Push)_

`POST` pushed to the core path `/snapshots`

__This is an integration that originates in the adapter and is pushed from the adapter to the core.__

A pushed snapshot is automatically marked as fulfilled.

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
assignmentXID | string | identifier for the associated assignment
description | string | a detailed human readable description of the snapshot
descriptionURL | string | a supporting URL relating to the update
details | object | a JSON object of extra supporting information returned by the adapter
status | string | a description of the assignment's current status
summary | string | a short human readable summary of the snapshot
value | string | the latest value returned by the adapter
xid | string | a unique external ID to identify the snapshot by

## Update Snapshot _(Push)_

`PATCH` pushed to the core path `/snapshots/:xid`

__This is an integration that originates in the adapter and is pushed from the adapter to the core.__

Only unfulfilled snapshots can be updated. When a snapshot is updated it is automatically marked as fulfilled.

Parameter | Type | Description
---- | ----- | --------
assignmentXID | string | identifier for the associated assignment
description | string | a detailed human readable description of the snapshot
descriptionURL | string | a supporting URL relating to the update
details | object | a JSON object of extra supporting information returned by the adapter
status | string | a description of the assignment's current status
summary | string | a short human readable summary of the snapshot
value | string | the latest value returned by the adapter
xid | string | a unique external ID to identify the snapshot by
